After you "evaluated the code" inside that "code block" (whatever that means), you and Emi jumped to another place. It seems that _"evaluate the code" is just a fancy way to say _"run the instructions"_.

You look around this place. Unlike the last place, this plane does have something: a big sign

"You are trapped in a dungeon called _dungeon.org_." Emi says.

Dungeon dot org? Is it a website? You ask.

"No. This is how an imaginary world is represented. To say it is a 'dungeon' is incorrect. It is more like a collection of worlds called planes. Each plane is one parallel world, but there is a plane that represents the world that you come from. Your plane. "Your world" you could say. When you arrive at your plane, you can leave these strange worlds behind and live in your comfy place."

Holy cow! Do you know the plane I come from? Is it the Plane 10? You ask.

"Emi doesn't shakes herself left and right as if to say no. But you realize that Emi and you can explore other planes as a team to ultimately find your way back to your plane."

Obviously Plane 10 is not my comfy plane. Let's leave this place and go to another plane, you suggest.

"Emi and you can't just 'leave this place'." Emi says.

Ah what? You exclaim.

Emi responds, "Inside Emi there is a program called _Org-mode_. You will need to talk to that program to escape a plane."

You think to yourself, What did Emi just say? Odd Mold? What's "Odd Mold"? It sounds like such a strange name.

Whatevs, you tell Emi, in an bold tone: whatever odd mold, NOW I ORDER YOU TO ESCAPE THIS PLANE!

"I'm sorry, but I can't do that. Emi's Org-mode doesn't speak regular English. Emi's Org-mode can only speak a language called *Emacs Lisp*. Or elisp for ..."

Emi abruptly stops speaking, and you notice that her tummy terminal display has changed again.

FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS

I am Org-mode, Emi's communication logic. Emi stated it imprecisely. Actually, I know English. At least, I can display instructions to you precisely in English. But you must talk to me in Emacs Lisp. Or more precisely, you need to write programs in Emacs Lisp. Only then will you be able to instruct me to jump between planes. The locations in parallel universes need to be programmed precisely and English is not precise enough for that task.

But you might not know MY very precise mother tongue. Luckily, all the logic inside Emi is _self-documented_. You merely need to know how to use Emi's "help system" to read the friendly manual of documentation. The escape function you desire is called *emi-escape-10*. To learn Emi's help system use your keyboard. Press the control and ~h~ keys down at the same time. Lift your fingers then press ~f~ (You can remember it as: /C/ontrol /h/elp for /f/uctions). Functions are English words with minus symbols between them. ~-~ Enter the escape function I mentioned previously. A magic window will appear below your plane to provide help. Follow the documentation to escape the plane. _It is a good practice to check the documentation of any function that you are going to run._

You might have noticed things such as the stars, underscores, and tilde characters in front of *emi-escape-10*, _dungeon.org_ and ~C-h f~. The formatting commands we're using is called "markup". We will use these formats to represent function names, emphasize keywords and indicate variable names and key combinations respectively. But their actually names are emi-escape-10, dungeon.org and C-h f. Don't type those markup indicators when you use these names in your program. As the communication logic of Emi, those markups improve our communication.

You may not understand 100% of what the instructions say. But give it a try and you will soon understand more and more.
