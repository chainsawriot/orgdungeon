That was tricky. You recall. Probably there will be more password-protected functions! But you solved it and you and Emi jumped to another plane.

Plane 30? Wow! You wonder how many planes are there. But you are more interested in escaping.

You sure have *emi-escape-30*, right? You ask Emi.

"Emi doesn't have *emi-escape-30*." Emi answers.

Holy moly! And you query Emi's terminal. She didn't lie: She doesn't have the function *emi-escape-30*.

You don't know what to do. And then Emi's stomach terminal display changes.

It's true that Emi doesn't have the function emi-escape-30. But I can tell you that the function to escape this plane is mapped to the key combination `C-c M-o`. But I think it would be helpful to learn more about Emi's help system.

You can check the "mapping" of a key combination by using Emi's help system. A key combination is always bound to a function. We can either say a function is _mapped_ to a function; or a function is _bound_ to a key combination. Even the arrow keys in Emi are mapped to a function!

You can trigger Emi's help system for checking key combinations using `C-h k` (\C\ontrol `h`elp `k`eys). And then press the key combination you want to query. For example, you want to check the function that has been bound to `C-g`, you can press `C-g` there. And it will tell you what function the key combination is bound to. In the case of `C-g`, the documentation would say:

"It is bound to C-g.

(keyboard-quit)"

The name of the function that is mapped to C-g is "keyboard-quit". You can infer it from the line (keyboard-quit).

OK, `C-c M-o` to escape, easy peasy.
