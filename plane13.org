You and Emi jumped to another plane. It's getting more tricky. And then you realise "same-piece" is an anagram of "emi-escape".

Emi runs around you like a dog and says "I know what you are going to ask Emi! Emi has *emi-escape-13*."

But now you know that thing is not gonna be _that_ easy. You decide to wait for org-mode to give you the now signiture cryptic instructions.

You wait and wait, but there is no update from Emi's terminal. Following the best practice, you have read the help file of *emi-escape-13*. It sure exists. But you can't run it using the ~M-x~ method.

Am I getting stuck? Will I be stuck forever? You think.

You reread the help file of *emi-escape-13*. There is a bit that is not familiar to you: _Please note that this is not an interactive function._

What does it mean? Perhaps is this bit that makes this function not runnable using the ~M-x~ method.

I am stuck. You think. Probably forever this time.

Emi doesn't seem to understand the situation. She's still running around like a dog.

Do you have any hints? Do you know why Org-mode doesn't show up? You ask Emi. But Emi doesn't understand these questions. Or is she pretending?

"Emi wants to ask you:" Emi suddenly asks "What is your favourite punctuation mark?"

That's an odd question to ask in such a dire situation. But that's fine because we are all stuck in such a crazy world. You told Emi your favourite punctuation?

"How about Emi's? What's Emi's favorite punctuation mark? or Marks?"

Actually you don't want to guess. But once again, Emi and you are stuck. So you ask Emi to give you some hints.

"Emi's favourite punctuation mark usually comes in pair. And it's not square or curly..." Emi tells you.

OK, that is easy. And you want to tell Emi her favourite punctuation mark.

Then Emi's terminal displays:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*guess-emi-favourite-punct*
#+END_QUOTE

#+RECAP: Emi's toolbox
