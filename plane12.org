Running the function, you and Emi jumped to another plane. That was easy, you think.

Again, this plane doesn't look like the world you used to live.

OK, this is Plane 12. There should be a function called *emi-escape-12*, right? You ask.

"Yes! Emi has *emi-esca*...!" Emi says.

Emi absurdly stops speaking. And her stomach terminal display changes again.

It's me again. I want to let you know that Emi has an important key combination called *keyboard-quit*. It is mapped precisely to ~C-g~. Pressing such key combination stops precisely the previous key combination. You can give it a try by first pressing ~M-x~, typing in some characters, and then press ~C-g~.

Also, you may notice that there is a new section called "Emi's toolbox". Along your travel, you will learn more about Emi's (almost limitless) functionalities.

The instructions are nonsense! You are not being helpful, org-mode! Your curse.

"Yes! Emi has *emi-escape-12*!" Emi repeats her unfinished sentence.

From the previous instructions, you know that ~M-x~ is probably the way to run a function. Maybe you can do the same for *emi-escape-12*?
